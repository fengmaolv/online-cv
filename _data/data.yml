    title: About me
    summary: |
      I am currently an assistant professor in Center of Statistical
      Research & School of Statistics, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics,
      China. My research interests are in machine learning, deep learning, transfer 
      learning and their applications in computer vision, e.g., semantic segmentation, 
      medical imaging analysis, etc.  
      
      I have openings for self-motivated undergraduate students, master students and PhD students (co-supervised). 
      Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research area.
